### Web Exercise 1: Introduction of GitHub and Online Data Science Resources

--------------

1. Your First name and Last name,

   ***Manisha Radhakrishna***

2. The URL to the BDA/GEOG594 class (in CANVAS)

   [BDA 594 Canvas Url](https://sdsu.instructure.com/courses/141078)

3. Your own definition of Big Data.

> Data can be gathered from every human action happening around us. They can originate from multiple sources in many formats. To analyze these processes and draw an effective outcome, we need to gather and process these data. 

> Thus, Big Data according to me would be collecting large complex data that is generated in a pace not processable by humans and thus needs advanced techniques for analyzing and extracting solutions for the betterment of society. 

4. (Optional) One photo. Make sure that you own the copyright of the photo.

### LAB-1 Questions

--------------

**3. Introduce ONE selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub with its URL and describe its potential applications and values.**

(or)

**7. Go to the awesome-datascience GitHub https://GitHub.com/bulutyazilim/awesome-datascience. From the “Data Sets” list, select one data set that interests you. Introduce the data set on your website. Make sure you include its URL. Also describe some potential applications for the data set.**

The Data Set selected is from the **data.gov** website (The home of the U.S. Government's open data). This data set is published by the *State of California* from the California Employment and Development Department. This is a Public data set that is Non-Federal and has no License information provided.

**Current Employment Statistics (CES)**

Data Set Link: [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/current-employment-statistics-ces](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/current-employment-statistics-ces)

The CES data on current employment by industry show jobs by **place of work**. The self-employed, unpaid family workers and private domestic employees are excluded. The employment figure does not represent a count of jobs held by locals but rather an estimate of the number of jobs in the area (independent of where the workers reside).
This dataset offers insights into the current employment trends within various industrial sectors in California.

Here's an overview of its contents:
* Number of people employed in various industries in California.
* It provides the breakdown of employment data into various sectors like healthcare, technology, financing, etc.
* It provides regional distribution of employment data.
* This data spans over a period which would help us analyze its trend.

Applications:
* Government bodies can analyze these trends to build policies, while local administrations can resolve employment challenges for regional development.
* Researchers and economists can explore the relationship between employment, economic growth, and other factors.
* Businesses can utilize this data for strategic workforce planning to refine staffing strategies and their growth, while labor market consultants can aid job seekers with demand trends.

In summary, this dataset stands as a valuable resource, shedding light on the dynamic employment landscape in California. It empowers various stakeholders, from policymakers to businesses, by providing insights into the state's economic vitality and workforce dynamics.


**4. Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute information. Explain briefly why you are interested in this book.**

(or)

**8. Got to the free-data-science-book GitHub: https://GitHub.com/chaconnewu/free-data-science-books. Select one book from the list that interests you. Introduce the book on your website. Make sure you include its URL and its author/institute information. Also, explain briefly why you are interested in this book.**

The Book selected from the free-data-science-book git repository is 

***Graph Algorithms: Practical Examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j*** 
by *Mark Needham*, and *Amy E. Hodler*.

Download Link: [https://web4.ensiie.fr/~stefania.dumbrava/GraphAlgorithms.pdf](https://web4.ensiie.fr/~stefania.dumbrava/GraphAlgorithms.pdf)

The book provides an introduction to fundamental graph algorithms, explaining their concepts, characteristics, and how they can be used to analyze various types of data and apply these algorithms to real-world scenarios. The book also provides practical examples and case studies, demonstrating how to use graph algorithms to solve specific problems. It also explores the integration of graph algorithms into data science workflows, allowing us to incorporate graph analysis into our broader data analysis processes.
