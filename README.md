3. Your own definition of Big Data.

> Data can be gathered from every human action happening around us. They can originate from multiple sources in many formats. To analyze these processes and draw an effective outcome, we need to gather and process these data. 

> Thus, Big Data according to me would be collecting large complex data that is generated in a pace not processable by humans and thus needs advanced techniques for analyzing and extracting solutions for the betterment of society.
